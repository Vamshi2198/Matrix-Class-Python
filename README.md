# Matrix-class-python
This project uses object oriented programmig to implement a matrix class in python

## Objective
Python does not implement operations with matrix data type directly. A matrix can be created using a nested list data type and by using the numpy library in python. To account for this, I have created a simple matrix class that can be imported as a .py file.

## Prerequisites/Dependencies  
* For this project, I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* To setup python in VS Code, follow instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
* You can also use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Vamshi2198/Matrix-class-python`.
2. Make sure you create a new .py file or .ipynb notebook in the same directory where matrix.py file exists.
3. import the Matrix class using `from matrix import Matrix, zeroes, identity`. The zeroes and identity functions are defined in matrix class and are required to do some operations with matrices.
4. You can use the basic operations by calling `Matrix.(function/object name)`. The overloaded operators are just called using symbols.
