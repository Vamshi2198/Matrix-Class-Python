# Matrix-class-python
This project uses object oriented programmig to implement a matrix class in python

## Objective
Python does not implement operations with matrix data type directly. A matrix can be created using a nested list data type and by using the numpy library in python. To account for this, I have created a simple matrix class that can be imported as a .py file.
