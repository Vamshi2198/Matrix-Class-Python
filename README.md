# Matrix-class-python
This project uses object oriented programmig to implement a matrix class in python

## Objective
Python does not implement operations with matrix data type directly. A matrix can be created using a nested list data type and by using the numpy library in python. To account for this, I have created a simple matrix class that can be imported as a .py file.

## Prerequisites/Dependencies  
1. For this project, I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. To setup python in VS Code, follow instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
3. You can also use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
